		<h1>About us</h1>
		<p>Sinthana project was started in the year 2010 as a book donation from the UK Bristol to Malawi with the sharing ideas between Brighten Ndawala (Malawian) and Lou Fitzpatrick(UK). Since, many people along the lake they don’t take school seriously they think fishing industry is the only way to go, we realized that in books there are hidden treasures. </p>
		<p>The definition of the word Sinthana means the spirit of exchange in a sense that having a space where people with different skills and background can come together and share knowledge and experiences everyone has with a reason of contributing towards community development.</p>
		<p>The aim was to transform the community into reading Culture, so that through reading of books our future children can excel in their studies and be better citizens of the community. Meaning to say the ideas was to change the mindset of the people not to rely on Fishing industry only as well as to stop early marriages of young girls. .</p>
